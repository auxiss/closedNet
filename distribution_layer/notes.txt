in this layer we use a system of posts to a rendevu point (untrusted server) to distribute the andpoint informasion.
for example peer A wonts to connect to peers b, c, d and so do those peer.
peer a will prepair a post containing the below.

post:
    1. pub_key
    2. priv_info (blake3b)

priv_info:
    1. endpoint
    2. wireguard_iface_pub_key
    3. username
    4. time_stump 

priv_info is encrypted with a gurp key shard with peers b, c, d.
this process is repeated for each peer that is part of the grup until all member peer have eachother informasion
