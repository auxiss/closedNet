\-- InterfaceManager.py     
| - No runtime peer management here
| - It’s file + lifecycle oriented
| - load() just binds to an interface
|
\-- interface.py  
| - Uses wg set under the hood
| - show() is the single source of truth
| - Peer objects are views over that data
|
\-- peer.py
| - Peer never calls wg
| - It delegates to interface.show()
| - That avoids repeated system calls and race conditions
